### Hacks I Learned
 - Learned how to customized my Snake Game
 - How to change the arrow key controls inot the WASD change and using various ASCII values.
 - Learned how to add emojis in to the game and change the square snake and dot onto circle to mimicked the apple emoji, since the cloud computers wont allow to copy and paste the apple emoji.
