## Summary of Accomplishments
-I learn many things through this experience in including adding <div>, <p>, <a>, tags. I also learned abt console.log(), how to create variables, how to create and manipulate array tags. 

## Struggles
-After a lot of trying, asking Chatgpt and asking Mr Lopez, my code wouldnt function properly in the jupyter notebooks. Even though I couldnt solve the problem, i copied and pasted my code into an post and made an md file out of it. In the md file my code worked perfercted fine! What a myserty!

## Sprite Struggles.
-For a every long my Sprite would not bwork. It would glitch a lot and run in and out of frame. I realized i had to get the sprite sheet from a website instead of screenshoting it. Also my sprite was rly fats and to fixed we created a function timestamp which which lowered the speed rate. We customized the scale factor and frame width and height to our sprite to make it run smoothly.

## All Togther
-All together i learned how to use Sprite Animations, I learn a few codes in JS, like creating variables, Arrays, Math functions, Maniplating Varibles, Aarays and Objects.
