### Struggles I Faced
  > 
  - Realzied that I had to commit and stage my changes into GitHub to save. <br>
  - Commit Button was loading a lot, so I pushed all the changes using the terminal <br>
  - My GitHub was not syncing to my Blog and so I created a Token to solve the problem <br>
  - My Token wouldnt work because I used the Fine-Grain Token instead of the Token (Classic), and set the expiration date to 90 days. <br>
